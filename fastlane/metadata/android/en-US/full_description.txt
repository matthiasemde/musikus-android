Boost your practice!

Musikus helps you while practicing your instrument with time tracking and other smart features.

This music practice app is designed to be a musician’s tool for everyday practice and help you in improving your habits. All you need in one app!

<b>Personalized Time Tracker:</b>
Start tracking your practice time for any piece, exercise, scale, or anything you want to practice with a single touch. Afterwards, you can rate your session and optionally add comment.

<b>Goals:</b>
Set daily, weekly or monthly time goals and check your results.

<b>Metronome:</b>
With adjustable tempo, subdivision and highlights on beats.

<b>Audio Recorder:</b>
Easily record and listen to yourself without switching apps.

<b>Statistics:</b>
Different diagrams and charts will show your improvements over time.

<b>Library:</b>
Define and manage your practice items (scales, pieces and other exercises...).

Disclaimer:
Musikus does some of it's work in the background. If you track a practice session, use the metronome, record yourself, or play a recording back, the app will continue tracking, playing or recording, even if you close it.
